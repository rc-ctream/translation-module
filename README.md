## Introduction

Welcome to your technical assignment for the **Lead AI Engineer** role at **LinguaAI**.

Our mission is to build a platform that eliminates **language barriers in real-time conversations**. The vision: two people speaking different languages should be able to communicate **fluently and naturally**, without noticeable delays or loss of meaning.

Unlike generic Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach is focused:
We aim to design a **lightweight, domain-specific model** that can achieve **superior performance in real-time translation** while relying only on **minimal training data** (limited vocabulary, grammar rules, and a small set of conversational examples).

As the potential Lead Engineer, we want to understand **how you conceptualize, architect, and organize** such a challenge.

## Task

Within **4 hours**, prepare a written document that covers the following:

### 1. Two alternative approaches

* **Concept**: Describe two distinct technical solutions to achieve our goal.
* **Architecture**: Provide a high-level architecture for each approach.
* **Technical procedure**: Explain how you would move from concept to implementation (training, optimization, deployment).
* **Innovation**: Wherever possible, incorporate **novel ideas, inventions, or cutting-edge methods** that could give LinguaAI a unique advantage.

### 2. Comparison of approaches

* Strengths and weaknesses
* Trade-offs (accuracy vs. latency, data requirements vs. model size, etc.)

### 3. Team setup

* Which roles and expertise would you include in your team to execute these approaches?
* Which positions are critical for the initial phase?

### 4. Recommendation

* Which approach would you prioritize and why?
* What concrete steps would you take in the **first 3 months** to move from idea to proof of concept?

## Guidelines

* **Timebox**: Maximum of 4 hours (offline work)
* **Output**: No page limit - focus on clarity, depth, and structure
* **Presentation**: You will present your results in **30â€“45 minutes**, followed by discussion and Q\&A
